# relialib

Package for basic reliability theory and system function analysis. 

## Project Goal
To help in the creation and interpretation of systems which are used in reliability theory. This project is designed to provide an intuitive interface between system design and a codified structure to interpret the given system and analyze its properties. 

## Example
Consider a series system with a parallel subsytem (show an image). 



Using relialib we can translate that system easily into a combination of Lists, Sets, and Integers which define the strucutre and system components. Once the strucutre is defined we can calculate the system function and then define path sets, path vectors, cut sets, cut vectors, minimal path sets, and many more.
